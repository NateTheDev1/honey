# What Is Honey? 🍯

Honey is a sweet and simple frontend framework opinionated on making developers lives easier. Built for TypeScript developers at the forefront and type safety as a priority. Honey uses JSX as its templating language and takes heavy inspiration from popular frameworks like React, Qwik, Angular, and more. Honey aims to be an out-of-the box solution for developers who want to get up and running quickly with a framework that is easy to learn in addition to their core framework or for developers who want to use Honey as their core framework.

## Why Honey?

Although there are plenty of well-built and highly popular frameworks out there, I felt I was missing a bridge between middle of the road frameworks like React, very lightweight frameworks like preact and qwik, and more heavy duty frameworks focusing on PWA's or SSR like NextJS. What I thought of was honey, a framework that not only was lightweight and fast, but the barrier to entry was light, and it comes with a handful of tools and features that make it easy to get up and running quickly.

## Features

## Data As A First Class Citizen

We know data has a hand in almost everything on the web today. In almost every conversation data plays a part and so honey is built with data and API manipulation as a first class citizen. Honey comes with built-in tools for data fetching, request cache diffing, distribution, and error handling.

## Honey Reports

Built-in, you are able to see different reports provided by honey to aid you in improving the quality of your craft. Although reports can be generated by other tools, honey provides a simple and easy to use interface to see these reports, as well as potential solutions for the issues that are found.

-   **Performance Report** - See how your application is performing and what you can do to improve it.
-   **Accessibility Report** - See how your application is performing in terms of accessibility and what you can do to improve it.
-   **Best Practices Report** - See how your application is performing in terms of best practices and what you can do to improve it.
-   **SEO Report** - See how your application is performing in terms of SEO and what you can do to improve it.

## Honey Workers

Honey comes with built-in workers that allows you to easily create web workers in your application. Unlike traditional service worker implementations, Honey workers are easy to create and easy to use.

## Honey DevTools

Honey comes with built-in devtools that can be that allows you to easily debug your application.

### Honey CUI

> `WUI` stands for `Web User Interface`

Honey development tools from the browser-side allow you to easily debug your application from the browser using a chrome extension to quickly see component state, application configuration, and more.

### Honey GUI

> `GUI` stands for `Graphical User Interface`

Honey development tools when working locally, optionally, allow you to easily debug your application from a locally hosted GUI page, inspired by the `GraphiQL` interface.

## Local And Global State Management

Honey comes with a built-in state management system that allows you to easily manage state in your application. You can create `jars` to manage state locally in your components or you can create `hives` to manage state globally in your application.

## Built-in Router

Honey comes with a built-in router that allows you to easily create routes for your application in your components with a single line, unlike other frameworks routing is a first class citizen in Honey. Honey's router is also very lightweight and fast as it's logic is built into the core of Honey and not a third party library.

## Incremental Virtual DOM

Honey uses an incremental virtual DOM to render its components. This is a huge performance boost over other frameworks that render the entire component tree on every render.

## Honey Scripts

Honey comes with a CLI tool that allows you to run Honey scripts. Honey scripts are a set of scripts that allow you to run common tasks like starting and building honey configurations.

## Create Honey App

Honey comes with a CLI tool that allows you to create a new Honey app with a single command. The CLI tool will create a new Honey app with all of the necessary files and folders to get you up and running quickly.

## JSX

Honey uses JSX as its templating language. JSX is a popular templating language that is used in frameworks like React, Preact, and Qwik. JSX is a great templating language because it is easy to learn, easy to read, and easy to write. JSX is also very powerful and allows for a lot of flexibility when it comes to templating.

## TypeScript

Honey is built for TypeScript developers. TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript that adds type safety to JavaScript. TypeScript is a great language because it allows for developers to write code that is more maintainable, easier to read, and easier to write. TypeScript is also a great language because it allows for developers to catch bugs before they happen and allows for developers to write code that is more robust.
